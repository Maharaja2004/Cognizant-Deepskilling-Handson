Annotations for REST:
Spring Boot leverages Spring MVC annotations for defining REST endpoints:
@RestController: Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, indicating that the class handles incoming web requests and that the return value of its methods should be bound directly to the web response body.
@RequestMapping: Maps web requests to specific handler methods.
@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping: Specialized annotations for handling specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
@RequestBody: Binds the HTTP request body to a method parameter.
@PathVariable: Extracts values from the URI path.
@RequestParam: Extracts values from query parameters.
