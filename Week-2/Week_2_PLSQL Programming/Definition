PL/SQL:

PL/SQL, which stands for Procedural Language/Structured Query Language, is a powerful extension of SQL that allows for procedural programming within the Oracle database environment. 
It combines the data manipulation capabilities of SQL with procedural constructs like loops, conditional statements, and variables, enabling developers to create robust and complex applications directly within the database.


TTD:

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. 
This approach involves writing a failing test, then writing the minimal amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactoring the code to improve its structure and maintainability. 
This cycle is often referred to as Red-Green-Refactor.
